SUMMARY:Year 9 Art - research on spinning tops
DESCRIPTION:Due 14th February at 12:00 pm. Submit either a hard-copy or email to tom@tomu.ca\n\nUsing your summary resource sheet and the capture card you completed from today's lesson\, research online some more into customary Maori spinning tops. Find answers to the following questions:\n- what materials were they made from?\n- how were they played with?\n- can you describe the different types of tops that there were?\n\nWhile you are looking at these questions\, find 3 images of Maori spinning tops that you like and bring them into class (either physically as a print out or submit the files to the school Trello board) to share for Monday's class!\n\nIf you get stuck or have any questions feel free to ask me!
